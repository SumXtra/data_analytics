# Possession Leverage in Football

## Overview
This project examines how **number of possessions** (one-possession vs. two-possession leads) impacts **win probability**, and whether going for 2 after a touchdown is strategically optimal under different game states.

## Hypothesis
Extending a lead from one possession to two increases win probability significantly more than the expected value of a single extra point, especially in late-game situations.

## Methods
- Python-based data analysis
- Statistical modeling (logistic regression + gradient boosting)
- Hypothesis testing and regression discontinuity
- SQL queries via DuckDB
- Clear communication via markdown storytelling and visuals

## Data
- Source: [`nflfastR`](https://github.com/nflverse/nflfastR-data) play-by-play data (2010â€“present)

## Deliverables
- Clean Jupyter notebook with modeling and visualizations
- Project plan + structured repo
- Executive summary with coaching takeaways
